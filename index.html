            <h3>Alan's life is not a journey (pun intended):</h3>
            <li><strong>1915</strong> - Alan Wilson Watts was born in the countryside near London, England.</li>
            <li><strong>1932</strong> - he produced his first booklet, An Outline of Zen Buddhism, a summary based on
                the Zen writings of D. T. Suzuki.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1938</strong> - he moved to the United States to study Zen in New York, where he soon began
                lecturing in bookstores and cafes and became an Episcopal priest for a time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - published The Meaning of Happiness, a book based on his talks. Ironically, the
                book was issued on the eve of the second World War.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> - Alan’s time as a priest had run its course, and he left the Church and Chicago
                for upstate New York. There he settled into a small farmhouse outside Millbrook.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1951</strong> - he moved to San Francisco where, at Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg’s invitation, he
                began teaching Buddhism at the American Academy of Asian Studies
            </li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - he accepted a Saturday evening slot on Berkeley’s KPFA radio station, then he
                began a broadcast series titled “The Great Books of Asia”
            </li>
            <li><strong>1956</strong> - began his popular radio show, “Way Beyond the West.”</li>
            <li><strong>By the early sixties</strong>, Alan’s radio talks aired nationally and the counterculture
                movement adopted him as a spiritual spokesperson.
            </li>
            <li><strong>By the late-sixties</strong>, he moved into a cabin on the nearby slopes of Mount Tamalpais.
                There he became part of the Druid Heights artist community in the late sixties.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1973</strong> - after returning from a whirlwind lecture tour that took him through the U.S.,
                Canada, and European, Alan passed away in his sleep, on the mountain he loved.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Alan Watts had the
                rare gift of ‘writing beautifully the un-writable’. Watts begins with scholarship and intellect and
                proceeds with art and eloquence to the frontiers of the spirit. A fascinating entry into the deepest
                ways of knowing.”</p>
